This branch contains files for the Task Manager and Weather Display features. After pushing all files from this branch, follow these post-deployment steps:

**Remote Site Setting:** Create a remote site setting for OpenWeatherMap with remotesiteurl as 'https://api.openweathermap.org
'
**FlexiPages:** Assign the FlexiPages as the default for now, as there are no specific users, permissions, or profiles configured yet.

**Implementation Choices and Rationale
**
**Weather Display:**
**Backend Design:** The backend was designed to retrieve and display key weather metrics such as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, current temperature, description, and humidity. An icon URL is also constructed to provide a visual representation of the weather. This approach was chosen to ensure the weather information is visually appealing, as the task emphasized user interface aesthetics.

**Future Enhancements:** Potential enhancements could include providing a clickable link to redirect users to the weather record or displaying additional details in a dialog box for a more comprehensive user experience.

**Historical Weather Data:** The UI was built with the assumption that multiple weather records might exist under a single location for historical tracking purposes. Therefore, the design includes displaying the last modified time on the location record page, allowing users to accurately see when the weather data was last updated.

**Real-Time Data Integration:** A REST API was implemented in an Apex trigger to fetch real-time weather data whenever a record is created or updated. This ensures that the displayed weather information is always up-to-date.

**Task Manager:
**
**User-Centric Design:** Since the task was to display the logged-in user's tasks, the standard procedure was followed to integrate it with the home page, which typically contains other standard components. The design was made user-friendly by opting for a layout similar to a related list, allowing users to easily interact with their tasks.

**Inline Editing and Pagination:** Inline editing for task statuses was implemented to streamline task management, along with buttons for completing and creating tasks. Pagination was included as a best practice to handle large sets of data efficiently and enhance the overall user experience.

These design choices were made to balance functionality, user experience, and future scalability.
